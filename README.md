# Paul Cloud
This is a personal project for a cloud based storage system written in Deno. I am mainly doing it as a learning project and probably won't get very far with it.

Normally I wouldn't make a repository like this public but I thought I would this time to give people a chance to take a look and maybe learn something from it.

I will be writing it using React in the front end.

## Welcome to Not Cloud!

This is your own personal cloud that is not in the cloud.

### TLDR

Do not use this if you don't know how to handle your own security. It is a simple tool that will allow you quick access to your data but it will assume that, if you are on your own network, you are allowed to view everything. There is no concept of users in this system. As a minimum security measure you should have;

- The server running this software behind a firewall
- The network hosting this server to be closed
- A secure VPN (really make sure you know how to do this) to connect remotely
- An encrypted hard drive on the server machine
  - THIS WILL NOT ENCRYPT YOUR PASSWORDS FOR YOU

### Not TLDR

Nothing yet! Hang tight, I'll update this with information at a later date.

## Installation

There is a simple script in the releases that you can run on any Linux server. You must have Docker installed.

# Not Cloud

This is designed to be a complete cloud solution to be hosted at home.

At the moment, it is a very simple password manager but I am using it at home so I will definitely be updating it.

## If you want to use it

THIS IS NOT SECURE! Make sure that this can only be accessed on a local network or behind a good VPN. Also make sure that you encrypt your hard drive, so as not to lose data.
